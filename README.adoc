= Spek

Spek is short for _specification_ and enhances Ruby gem
link:https://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference[specifications] with additional information
and tooling. You can use this library as foundational support to build on top of with your own
enhancements.

toc::[]

== Features

* Supports finding gems by name.
* Supports loading gems by path to specification.
* Supports picking gems by name with optional version selection.
* Supports link:https://semver.org[semantic versions] via
  link:https://alchemists.io/projects/versionaire[Versionaire].

== Requirements

. link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby].

== Setup

To set up the project, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/setup
----

== Usage

This gem makes interacting with Ruby gems easier by providing foundational objects for which you can
built on top of. link:https://alchemists.io/projects/gemsmith[Gemsmith] is built on top of this
gem if you need working example.

=== Presenter

This object wraps the `Gem::Specification` for presentation purposes, provides semantic versioning, direct access to metadata information, pathnames, and other enriched information. You can obtain an
instance using the following code, for example:

[source,ruby]
----
specification = Gem::Specification.new do |spec|
  spec.name = "demo"
  spec.version = "0.0.0"
  spec.authors = ["Jill Smith"]
  spec.email = ["demo@alchemists.io"]
  spec.homepage = "https://alchemists.io/projects/demo"
  spec.summary = "A demo summary."
  spec.license = "Hippocratic-2.1"

  spec.signing_key = Gem.default_key_path
  spec.cert_chain = [Gem.default_cert_path]

  spec.metadata = {
    "bug_tracker_uri" => "https://github.com/bkuhlmann/demo/issues",
    "changelog_uri" => "https://alchemists.io/projects/demo/versions",
    "homepage_uri" => "https://alchemists.io/projects/demo",
    "funding_uri" => "https://github.com/sponsors/bkuhlmann",
    "label" => "Demo",
    "rubygems_mfa_required" => "true",
    "source_code_uri" => "https://github.com/bkuhlmann/demo"
  }
end

presenter = Spek::Presenter.new specification

presenter.allowed_push_host  # "https://rubygems.org"
presenter.allowed_push_key   # "rubygems_api_key"
presenter.authors            # ["Jill Smith"]
presenter.banner             # "Demo 0.0.0: A demo summary."
presenter.certificate_chain  # [#<Pathname:~/.gem/gem-public_cert.pem>]
presenter.documentation_url  # "https://alchemists.io/projects/demo"
presenter.emails             # ["demo@alchemists.io"]
presenter.funding_url        # "https://github.com/sponsors/bkuhlmann"
presenter.homepage_url       # "https://alchemists.io/projects/demo"
presenter.issues_url         # "https://github.com/bkuhlmann/demo/issues"
presenter.label              # "Demo"
presenter.labeled_summary    # "Demo: A demo summary."
presenter.labeled_version    # "Demo 0.0.0"
presenter.named_version      # "demo 0.0.0"
presenter.package_name       # "demo-0.0.0.gem"
presenter.package_path       # #<Pathname:tmp/demo-0.0.0.gem>
presenter.rubygems_mfa?      # true
presenter.signing_key        # #<Pathname:~/.gem/gem-private_key.pem>
presenter.source_path        # #<Pathname:~/.cache/.../3.2.0/gems/demo-0.0.0>
presenter.source_url         # "https://github.com/bkuhlmann/demo"
presenter.version            # #<struct Versionaire::Version major=0, minor=0, patch=0>
presenter.versions_url       # "https://alchemists.io/projects/demo/versions"
----

The presenter is a read-only object so you'll only have access to _getter_ methods which are mostly
documented link:https://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference[here]. Please note that not all
methods map one-to-one so you'll want to look at the public API of this object for further details.

=== Loader

When given a path to a gem specification file, the loader will load a gem specification for you.
Example:

[source,ruby]
----
presenter = Spek::Loader.call "path/to/my/test.gemspec"
presenter.class  # Spek::Presenter
----

=== Finder

The finder will find all gem specifications for a given name. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
presenters = Spek::Finder.call "refinements"
presenters.map(&:class)  # [Spek::Presenter]
----

=== Picker

When given a gem name, this will allow you pick from a list of gem versions if any. Otherwise, if
multiple versions don't exist, the first version found will be answered instead. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
require "dry/monads"

include Dry::Monads[:result]

case Spek::Picker.call("refinements")
  in Success(specification) then puts "You selected: #{specification.name}."
  in Failure(error) then puts error
end
----

The picker always answers a link:https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-monads[monad] so you can quickly
link:https://alchemists.io/articles/ruby_pattern_matching[pattern match] for further action.

=== Versioner

When given a version and path, the versioner will update the version of your gem specification.
Example:

[source,ruby]
----
specification = Spek::Versioner.call "1.0.0", "path/to/my/test.gemspec"
specification.version  # <struct Versionaire::Version major=1, minor=0, patch=0>
----

This makes it easier to automate the updating of your gem specification version information.

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/spek
cd spek
bin/setup
----

You can also use the IRB console for direct access to all objects:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

== Tests

To test, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/rake
